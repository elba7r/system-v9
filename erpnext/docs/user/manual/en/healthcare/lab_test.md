In many Laboratories, approval of Lab Tests is a must before printing and submitting the document. Revalue ERP Healthcare allows you to create Users with Role "Lab Test Approver" for this. You will also have to enable this in
>Healthcare Settings > Laboratory Settings > Require Lab Test Approval

This will ensure that emailing or printing of Lab Tests can only be done after Approval of the Lab Test by the Lab Test Approver.
