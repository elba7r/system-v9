# Pharmacy
Revalue ERP Healthcare do not have a Pharmacy module - but you can configure the Stock module to manage your stock and Accounts and Buying modules for Billing and Purchases. The stock module allows you to configure Items with serial numbers and Batches. Expiry dates can be set if you turn on the "Has Batch No" check. You can also configure the auto reorder levels if required.
