Expense Claim is made when Employee’s make expenses out of their pocket on behalf of the company. For example, if they take a customer out for lunch, they can make a request for reimbursement via the Expense Claim form.

To make a new Expense Claim, go to:

> HR > Expense Claim > New Expense Claim

Set the Employee ID, date and the list of expenses that are to be claimed and
“Submit” the record.

### Approving Expenses

Approver for the Expense Claim is selected by an Employee himself. Users to whom `Expense Approver` role is assigned will shown in the Expense Claim Approver field.

After saving Expense Claim, Employee should [Assign document to Approver]({{docs_base_url}}/user/manual/en/using-eprnext/assignment.html). On assignment, approving user will also receive email notification. To automate email notification, you can also setup [Email Alert]({{docs_base_url}}/user/manual/en/setting-up/email/email-alerts.html).

Expense Claim Approver can update the “Sanctioned Amounts” against Claimed Amount of an Employee. If submitting, Approval Status should be submitted to Approved or Rejected. If Approved, then Expense Claim gets submitted. If rejected, then Expen
Comments can be added in the Comments section explaining why the claim was approved or rejected.

### Booking the Expense and Reimbursement

The approved Expense Claim must then be converted into a Journal Entry and a
payment must be made. Note: This amount should not be clubbed with Salary
because the amount will then be taxable to the Employee.
