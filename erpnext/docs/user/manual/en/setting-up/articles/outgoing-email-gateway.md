#Outgoing Email Gateway

In the Revalue ERP, you can customize incoming and Outgoing Email Gateway. On saving an Email Account, Revalue ERP tries establishing a connection with your email gateway. If your Revalue ERP account is able to connect fine, then Email Account master is saved. If not, then you might receive an error as indicated below.

This indicates that using login credentials and other email gateway details provided, Revalue ERP is not able to connect to your email server. Please ensure that you have entered valid email credentials for your Email Gateway. Once you have configured Email Account successfully, you should be able to send and receive emails from your Revalue ERP account fine.

Note: Your Revalue ERP account is connected with Revalue ERP email server by default. If you don't want to use your own email server, you can continue sending emails using an Revalue ERP email server.
