As per the perpetual inventory system, accounts posting is done for every stock transaction.

On creating new Warehouse, the system will automatically create an Account in the Chart of Accout, with the same name as Warehouse Name.

On receipt of items in a particular warehouse, the balance in the Warehouse Account will increase. Similarly when items are delivered from the Warehouse, an expense will be booked, and balance in the Warehouse Account will reduce.

##Activation

  1. Setup the following default accounts for each Company. These accounts are created automatically in the new Revalue ERP accounts.

    * Stock Received But Not Billed
    * Stock Adjustment Account
    * Expenses Included In Valuation
    * Cost Center
	
  2. Ensure each Warehouse is an Account in the Chart of Accounts master. As per the default configuration, Accounts for Warehouse are created under `Assets > Current Asset > Stock Assets > (Warehouse)`

  3. Activate Perpetual Inventory

	 > Explore > Accounts > Accounts Settings > "Make Accounting Entry For Every Stock Movement"

###Purchase Receipt

Suppose you have purchased _10 nos_ of item "RM0001" at _$200_ and _5 nos_ of item "Base Plate" at **$100** from supplier "East Wind Inc". Following are the details of Purchase Receipt:

**Supplier:** East Wind Inc.

**Items:**

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Item</th>
            <th>Warehouse</th>
            <th>Qty</th>
            <th>Rate</th>
            <th>Amount</th>
            <th>Valuation Amount</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>RM0001</td>
            <td>Stores</td>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>200</td>
            <td>2000</td>
            <td>2250</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Taxes:</strong>
</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Account</th>
            <th>Amount</th>
            <th>Category</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Shipping Charges</td>
            <td>100</td>
            <td>Total and Valuation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>VAT (10%)</td>
            <td>200</td>
            <td>Total</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Customs Duty</td>
            <td>150</td>
            <td>Valuation</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

**Stock Ledger**

**General Ledger**

<img class="screenshot" alt="Perpetual Inventory" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/accounts/perpetual-3.png">

As stock balance increases through Purchase Receipt, "Store" accounts are debited and a temporary account "Stock Receipt But Not Billed" account is credited, to maintain double entry accounting system. At the same time, negative expense is booked in account "Expense included in Valuation" for the amount added for valuation purpose, to avoid double expense booking.

* * *

###Purchase Invoice

On receiving Bill from supplier, for the above Purchase Receipt, you will make Purchase Invoice for the same. The general ledger entries are as follows:

**General Ledger**

<img alt="General" class="screenshot" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/old_images/Revalue ERP/accounting-for-stock-4.png">

Here "Stock Received But Not Billed" account is debited and nullified the
effect of Purchase Receipt.

###Delivery Note

Lets say, you have an order from "Jane Doe" to deliver 5 nos of item "RM0001"
at $300. Following are the details of Delivery Note:

**Customer:** Jane Doe

**Items:**
<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Item</th>
            <th>Warehouse</th>
            <th>Qty</th>
            <th>Rate</th>
            <th>Amount</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>RM0001</td>
            <td>Stores</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>300</td>
            <td>1500</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Taxes:</strong>
</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Account</th>
            <th>Amount</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Service Tax</td>
            <td>150</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>VAT</td>
            <td>100</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

**Stock Ledger**

**General Ledger**

<img alt="General" class="screenshot" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/old_images/Revalue ERP/accounting-for-stock-6.png">

As item is delivered from "Stores" warehouse, "Stores" account is credited and
equal amount is debited to the expense account "Cost of Goods Sold". The
debit/credit amount is equal to the total valuation amount (buying cost) of
the selling items. And valuation amount is calculated based on your prefferred
valuation method (FIFO / Moving Average) or actual cost of serialized items.

    
    
        
    In this example, we have considered valuation method as FIFO. 
    Valuation Rate  = Purchase Rate + Charges Included in Valuation 
                    = 200 + (250 * (2000 / 2500) / 10) 
                    = 220
    Total Valuation Amount  = 220 * 5 
                            = 1100

###Sales Invoice with Update Stock

Lets say, you did not make Delivery Note against the above order and instead
you have made Sales Invoice directly, with "Update Stock" options. The details
of the Sales Invoice are same as the above Delivery Note.

**Stock Ledger**

**General Ledger**

<img alt="General" class="screenshot" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/old_images/Revalue ERP/accounting-for-stock-8.png">

Here, apart from normal account entries for invoice, "Stores" and "Cost of
Goods Sold" accounts are also affected based on the valuation amount.
