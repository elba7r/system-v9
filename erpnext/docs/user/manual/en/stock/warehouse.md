A warehouse is a commercial building for storage of goods. Warehouses are used
by manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport businesses,
customs, etc. They are usually large plain buildings in industrial areas of
cities, towns, and villages. They mostly have loading docks to load and unload
goods from trucks.

To go to Warehouse, click on Stock and go to Warehouse under Setup.  You
could also switch to 'Tree' View or simply type warehouse tree in the awsone bar.

In Revalue ERP, every Warehouse must belong to a specific company, to maintain
company wise stock balance. The Warehouses are saved with their respective
companyâ€™s abbreviations. This facilitates in identifying which Warehouse
belongs to which company, at a glance.

You can include user restrictions for these Warehouses. In case you do not
wish a particular user to operate on a particular Warehouse, you can refrain
the user from accessing that Warehouse.

> Note: Revalue ERP system maintains stock balance for every distinct combination
of Item and Warehouse. Thus you can get stock balance for any specific Item in
a particular Warehouse on any particular date.
