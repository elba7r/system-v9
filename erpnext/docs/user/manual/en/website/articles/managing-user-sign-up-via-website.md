As seen above the login / sign-up button appears on the homepage of the website generated using Revalue ERP.

One might want to disable this feature to prevent anonymous users from signing up via the web.

To do so, Go to 

1. ` Website > Setup > Website Settings ` 

2. In website settings doctype navigate to the misc section.

3. Check the disable SignUp check-box and save the doc.

Now only the login button will appear and there shall be no option to sign-up via the website. You can always revert back by following the same steps.
